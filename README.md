import { machineId } from 'node-machine-id';
const computerUsername = machineId() // Returns Promise
```

#### computerUsername

import os from 'os';
const computerUsername = os.userInfo().username;
```

Machine name for the user to know which computer the license is issued for.

```
import os from 'os';
